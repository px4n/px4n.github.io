      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning, or maybe I should say Goodnight. 🌙&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s approximately 7am.
&lt;img src=&#34;gallery/7am_outside.png&#34; alt=&#34;7am Outside&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the whole night messing around with the Hugo, Docker, Ansible and a few other pieces of tech as I enjoy my one week break after leaving my previous employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I feel like a little schoolboy again who is too excited to sleep the night before a school trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ❤️ tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this week, more so, this sleepless night I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully migrated domains and in the process have had to enjoy the pain of updating my contact and login e-mail addresses everywhere (surely there must be an app for this!). However, the pain of having to do this has been a good auditing exercise for me and is something I recommend everyone to be doing on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found accounts that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;haven&amp;rsquo;t been logged into for years 🙉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;were using completely wrong e-mail addresses 🙈&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;had their 2FA configured incorrectly 🙊&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their login data was so old I had no way of accessing the account 💀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine sorting out all of that and cleaning up my online digital footprint alone has taken up a good portion of this week but it has felt great.&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve also been writing scripts for tiny things here and there and tweaking things to get them just right whilst linking API&amp;rsquo;s together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;m running my own password manager, read-it-later and RSS feeder services and have a fresh new site, the next thing on my list is brain dump of everything into my inbox in my GTD system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is looking equally painful, as you can see&amp;hellip;
&lt;img src=&#34;gallery/ttd_inbox_notes.png&#34; alt=&#34;GTD Inbox List&#34;&gt;
And above is just the tip of the iceberg&amp;hellip;😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;rsquo;ll be starting at &lt;a href=&#34;https://exawizards.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ExaWizards Inc&lt;/a&gt; next week, which I&amp;rsquo;m super &lt;em&gt;SUPER&lt;/em&gt; excited about, and I have more than enough personal and start-up projects to get on with now as well.⚡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are going to get busy around here 👊, and just before they do, I will take a quick break to continue watching &lt;a href=&#34;http://heromask.jp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hero Mask&lt;/a&gt; (it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite decent and the British setting and background scenes are really nostalgic to watch).
