Yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the whole night messing around with the Hugo, Docker, Ansible and a few other pieces of tech as I enjoy my one week break after leaving my previous employer.\nHonestly, I feel like a little schoolboy again who is too excited to sleep the night before a school trip.\nI ❤️ tech.\nSo this week, more so, this sleepless night I\u0026rsquo;ve successfully migrated domains and in the process have had to enjoy the pain of updating my contact and login e-mail addresses everywhere (surely there must be an app for this!). However, the pain of having to do this has been a good auditing exercise for me and is something I recommend everyone to be doing on a regular basis.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found accounts that:\n haven\u0026rsquo;t been logged into for years 🙉 were using completely wrong e-mail addresses 🙈 had their 2FA configured incorrectly 🙊 their login data was so old I had no way of accessing the account 💀  As you can imagine sorting out all of that and cleaning up my online digital footprint alone has taken up a good portion of this week but it has felt great.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been writing scripts for tiny things here and there and tweaking things to get them just right whilst linking API\u0026rsquo;s together.\nNow that I\u0026rsquo;m running my own password manager, read-it-later and RSS feeder services and have a fresh new site, the next thing on my list is brain dump of everything into my inbox in my GTD system.\nHowever, this is looking equally painful, as you can see\u0026hellip; And above is just the tip of the iceberg\u0026hellip;😱\nIn other news, I\u0026rsquo;ll be starting at ExaWizards Inc next week, which I\u0026rsquo;m super SUPER excited about, and I have more than enough personal and start-up projects to get on with now as well.⚡\nThings are going to get busy around here 👊, and just before they do, I will take a quick break to continue watching Hero Mask (it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite decent and the British setting and background scenes are really nostalgic to watch).
